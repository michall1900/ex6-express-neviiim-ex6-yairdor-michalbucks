<h1>Ex6 - Yair Dor and Michal Bucks</h1>
<h5>Yair's email : yairdo@edu.hac.ac.il, id's: 318169505</h5>
<h5>Michal's email : michalbu@edu.hac.ac.il, id's: 205980725</h5>

<h3>Note: Maybe part of the code will be similar to Eliad Karni's exercise (the part in this program that using ex5). 
Yair and Michal become a couple, Yair and Eliad done ex5 together, so we are taking code from both exercises (ex5 of Yair and Eliad
and ex5 of Michal).</h3>

<h3>Note: We have done the polling thing</h3>

<h5>Server api</h5>
<div>
In each point here we'll explain how does it work for each url:
    <ol>
        <li> 
            get "/" - When user is not login, "/" is refers to login page (its url is "/") - it will show the user login page 
            that is given with view. When user is login, if he is trying to get "/", the server return him the home page without errors 
            (We think that user shouldn't get an error if he is trying to get home page when he is login, just redirect him to home page).
        </li> 
        <li>
            post "/" - Is using to 
        </li>
    </ol>
</div>
